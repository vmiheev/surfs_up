* The following are the summary statistics for December:
![Dec](/Resources/dec_temps.png)

### Observations
* The results show that on average the temperature in December is approximately 4 degrees lower
* The results show that the standard deviation of the temperatures is higher in December
* The quartiles are consistently 3-4 degrees lower in December. However, the minimum temperatures have an 8 degree difference.

## Summary

The summary statistics indicate that December is colder, but not by a large amount, meaning that weather-sensitive businesses should be sustainable year-round. The higher standard deviation in December indicates that the changes in temperature should be more pronounced. While the quartiles in December are consistently 3-4 degrees lower than in June, the minimum temperature is 8 degrees lower, suggesting that there may be occasional outliers that cause minimal business loss.
In order to enhance the analysis, two additional queries can be performed: a query of the precipitation and a query of the wind speed, which are both indicators of customer traffic for a beach-side business.
